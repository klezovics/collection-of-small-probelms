This repository is a collection of solutions to programming challenges, olympiad programming problems and various other 
small problems. Each solution is typically implemented within the body of a single class. The text of the problem is given in a comment 
at the top of each class.

The solutions are grouped into packages roughly by topic and/or a key technology, which is required to solve the problem. 

In order to run these solutions - just do a pull of the repository and run the classes you are interested in one at a time.
